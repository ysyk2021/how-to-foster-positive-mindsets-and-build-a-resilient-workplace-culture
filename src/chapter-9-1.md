There are several reasons why it's important to incorporate positive mindsets and resilience into company policies and practices:

## Boosting employee well-being

Positive mindsets and resilience can improve employee well-being by reducing stress, increasing job satisfaction, and fostering a sense of purpose and fulfillment in their work.
